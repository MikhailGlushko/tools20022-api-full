/**
 * <b>Scope</b><br>
 * The Unable To Apply message is sent by a case creator or a case assigner to a
 * case assignee. This message is used to initiate an investigation of a payment
 * instruction that cannot be executed or reconciled.<br>
 * <b>Usage</b><br>
 * The Unable To Apply case occurs in two situations:<br>
 * - an agent cannot execute the payment instruction due to missing or incorrect
 * information<br>
 * - a creditor cannot reconcile the payment entry as it is received
 * unexpectedly, or missing or incorrect information prevents reconciliation<br>
 * The Unable To Apply message<br>
 * - always follows the reverse route of the original payment instruction<br>
 * - must be forwarded to the preceding agents in the payment processing chain,
 * where appropriate<br>
 * - covers one and only one payment instruction (or payment entry) at a time;
 * if several payment instructions cannot be executed or several payment entries
 * cannot be reconciled, then multiple Unable To Apply messages must be sent.<br>
 * Depending on what stage the payment is and what has been done to it, for
 * example incorrect routing, errors/omissions when processing the instruction
 * or even the absence of any error, the unable to apply case may lead to a:<br>
 * - Additional Payment Information message, sent to the case creator/case
 * assigner, if a truncation or omission in a payment instruction prevented
 * reconciliation.<br>
 * - Request To Cancel Payment message, sent to the subsequent agent in the
 * payment processing chain, if the original payment instruction has been
 * incorrectly routed through the chain of agents (this also entails a new
 * corrected payment instruction being issued). Prior to sending the payment
 * cancellation request, the agent should first send a resolution indicating
 * that a cancellation will follow (CWFW).<br>
 * - Request To Modify Payment message, sent to the subsequent agent in the
 * payment processing chain, if a truncation or omission has occurred during the
 * processing of the original payment instruction. Prior to sending the modify
 * payment request, the agent should first send a resolution indicating that a
 * modification will follow (MWFW).<br>
 * - Debit Authorisation Request message, sent to the case creator/case
 * assigner, if the payment instruction has reached an incorrect creditor. The
 * UnableToApply message has the following main characteristics: - Case
 * Identification and Reason Code: The case creator (the instructed
 * party/creditor of a payment instruction) assigns a unique case identification
 * and optionally the reason code for the Unable To Apply message. This
 * information will be passed unchanged to all subsequent case assignees. -
 * Underlying Payment Instruction Identification: The case creator specifies the
 * identification of the underlying payment instruction. This identification
 * needs to be updated by the subsequent case assigner(s) in order to match the
 * one used with their case assignee(s). - Unable To Apply Justification: The
 * Unable To Apply Justification element allows the assigner to indicate whether
 * a specific element causes the unable to apply situation (incorrect element
 * and/or mismatched element can be listed) or whether any supplementary
 * information needs to be forwarded.
